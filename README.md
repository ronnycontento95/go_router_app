# go_router

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

## Project Description with GoRouter
I have developed a project in Flutter using go_router, an advanced routing package that simplifies navigation between pages and route management in Flutter applications. GoRouter provides a declarative and efficient way to handle navigation, especially in apps with multiple screens and complex flows.

## Key Features of the Project:
Declarative Navigation:
I use go_router to define routes declaratively, enabling smooth and predictable navigation between different screens in the app. Each route is associated with a specific widget, making the codebase well-organized.

## Parameterized Routes:
I have implemented routes that accept dynamic parameters, allowing efficient data passing between screens. For example, I can navigate to a details screen by passing an ID or any other required data.

## Nested Navigation:
The project includes nested routes to handle complex navigation flows, such as tabs or side menus. This ensures consistent state management and intuitive navigation for the user.

## Route Protection (Guards):
I have implemented guards to protect certain routes, ensuring that only authenticated users can access specific screens. This is particularly useful for apps that require authentication.

## Deep Linking:
Thanks to go_router, the app supports deep linking, allowing users to directly access a specific screen from an external link (e.g., from an email or notification).

## Custom Transitions:
I have added custom transitions between screens to enhance the user experience, leveraging Flutter's animation capabilities.

## Navigation State Management:
GoRouter simplifies navigation state management, enabling route resetting or returning to previous screens without losing context.
